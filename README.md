ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tobsan, I work at @eub-sweden.

I like free software and Dance Dance Revolution. I usually write C code or something similar for small real-time systems or Linux for a living.

I would like to do more coding towards the web in my spare time, but preferrably without being dependent on JavaScript. Hook me up if you have some ideas!
